# Assignment 1 - Group Part

## 2 min. pitch

Maybe it helps to restate some of the concepts I talked about in the documents I sent: the cosmos has a web-like structure on smaller scales in which the mass elements that make up the web move from one type of structure to another in particular ways. (according to gravitational instability theory and anisotropic collapse).
As far as the professor has told me, there is a gap in research because this phenomenon was analysed for very small redshifts only (from today to z = 2). It would be very interesting though, to see what kind of areas in the early universe these mass components in each structure type came from.

## Feedback

### clear interest and research project

(curiosities rather than feedback) I feel like there could have been an extra sentence about your personal interest in QED. Which heavy molecules will you be looking at?

### mindmap

I think I would have like to see each bubble in the map somehow explained in the paper summary or the connections between them made clear.
