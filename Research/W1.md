### Mass Transport

Structure at certain length scales (cosmic web) to some extent implies an anisotropic medium. How these structures change in time is predicted by **gravitational instability theory** which says that "an overdense region first collapses along the direction with the largest positive eigenvalue of the deformation tensor" which will give rise to a pancake-like distribution. If these regions have a second positive eigenvalue, then a collapse along this axis take place as well and results a filament-like region. Regions with 3 positive eigenvalues contract along all directions and give rise to "fully collapse structures". This predicts a well-defined evolution of the matter distribution.

mass flow: voids -> walls -> filaments -> nodes (**anisotropic collapse theory**)

Some exceptions were found by the paper, but it turned out to be in the underdense regions that were most difficult to categorise properly.

#### common mass fraction

A concept that will likely come in handy in what I'm doing is the quantitative analysis of mass transport accross morphological components.

$f_{i j}(z_1, z_2) = \frac{M_{(i, z_1) \cap (j,z_2)}  }{M_{(i, z_1)}}$

- $M_{(i, z_1)}$ is the mass in environment i at redshift $z_1$
- $M_{(i, z_1) \cap (j,z_2)}$ is the mass overlap between component i and j, with the first at redshift $z_1$ and the second at redshift $z_2$. This is computed using the id tag of the DM particles.

This quantity can have two meanings, depending on the relationship between $z_1$ and $z_2$:

1. $\mathbf{z_1 < z_2}$: it reveals the fraction of the mass in environment i at $z_1$ that originated from environment j at $z_2$
2. $\mathbf{z_1 > z_2}$: it reveals the fraction of the mass in environment i at $z_1$ which can be found at a later $z_2$ to be contained in environment j

This makes sense because the earlier time you want to go to, the larger the redshift z. Depending on which moment in time we put in the denominator, the fraction switches its meanings

## Questions

### for Rien

- what are merger trees and how relevant are they actually to what I'm personally doing
