# Week 3 Findings

## for coding

- I tried looking for the biggest subhaloes in spanshot 135 and got their IDs. Then I realised that these change per snapshot, which means I could not use the subhalo IDs from different snapshots to make a nice plot of the same mass elements moving in time. I decided to use the particle IDs for some big subhaloes in 135 and see what those particular particles were doing earlier as well as looking at an earlier snapshots big halo particles and seeing how they evolve din the future (reversing)

- downloaded the regular illustris data set because I copy-pasted like an idiot. In this context I learned how to delete a non-empty directory: **rm -r \[directory]**

- managed to get a nice visualisation of movement by putting together a gif of some given subhalo and its particles at different redshift values
