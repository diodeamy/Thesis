# Week 5 Findings

## paper (cautun et al 2014)

- NEXUS and NEXUS+ are really nice because they can identify cosmic structure in a scale-free way. This allows for the detection and **classification of both prominent and tenuous structure**, as well as it allows **direct comparison of different environments** and **characterisation of the connectivity between different environments**.

- the authors of the paper used both a halo and a subhalo finder; the final halos only contain gravitationally bound particles. The center points are computed by looking at the highest-density regions (more detail specified in paper)

- **the methods employed take as input density and velocity fields computed using DTFE**

- NEXUS+ applies a logarithmic-Gaussian filter for smoothing. This means that unlike NEXUS, which uses a Gaussian filter, it can only be applied to positive-valued fields: density

## Questions

- the paper says that the DTFE method does not depend on any user input parameters but it doesn't, for instance sigma and omega or the length of the box (maybe others as well). Will this matter for my project?

- how does one compute the density and velocity divergence fields "on some grid" of a particular $/Delta$x spacing?

- what does a smoothing filter actually do (ie why is it necessary to do)?
