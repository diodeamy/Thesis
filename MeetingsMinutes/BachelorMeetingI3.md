# Individual Meeting 3 (31.05)

## Code

- what threshold values should I keep in mind? the programs may have bad default values

- Field interpolation: **unaveraged** or **volume averaged**? (recommended: density-> vol averaged, velocity-> unaveraged)

- should the numevr of grid cells be the same as the number of particles? (or should they be gid cells = sqrt(number of particles))

## Writing Skeleton

- Illustris Simulation

    Introduce the simulation, the data, (any important characteristics that must be mentioned in the report?) and add some of the initial histograms of the data

- Gravitational Collapse bit

    Here I can put some snapshots from the gifs to highlight visually how objects do tend to go void->wall->filament->node

- DTFE

    Find a way to put intermediary results here (and again mention important characteristics and numbers of the algorithm)

- NEXUS

    Talk about the algorithm a bit (mention the important parameters); there are a lot of graphs that are in the pythonNEXUS.py file. Any of note? If not, then make my own to show what Cautun et.al. 2014 showed but to a bigger redshift.
