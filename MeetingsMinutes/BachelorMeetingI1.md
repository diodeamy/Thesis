# Individual Meeting 1 (01.05)

## Questions accumulated

- How to actually use Nexus?

- do you have actual books where I can learn a little bit more about cosmic structure formation? (like for the master course, are they most relevant?)

- use redshift 2, 5, etc: take a region from redhsift 5 and follow it to today, and look at a void as well and do both the other way around; do 5 different configurations

- do 2013 nexus and 2014 with a lot of results

- unwrap the nexus code and there's a lot of descriptive

- DTFE assumes the gadget something filetype and illustris
