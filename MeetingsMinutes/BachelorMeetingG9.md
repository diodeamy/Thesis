## famous football game of 1974

the football team was amazing, final in munich in germany. Rien is "that old"

in 1998 they beat the Germans in Germany for the semi-final and behaved appallingly. DUtch were in millions on the highway to see the team back

look for margeret thacher destroyed by the people from the news night programme in bbc

## writing notes

don't be afraid to speculate. structure your discussion as a debate, an argument. give it some spice. put it in the context of other people's work. what might it imply? think about what your results mean in the bigger picture.

for PHDs statements: few of what's simply in the thesis (state the obvious); doa few on general issues (the biggest border in the world is the one between NL and FR: he had a friend from BE); attack the examiners in your statements

it is clear who is world champion in 1974: GE beat NL 2-1.

discussion should be pretty straight forward for me. look at protofilamentary structure and see where it comes from.
