# Group Meeting 3 (03.05)

- threshold parameters to classify voids : deltas should be -0.08. that is really underdense

- using inertia tensors to determine the shapes of objects. Determine 3 main axes first from the tensor (ellipsoid kind of a first order approximation) if it's oriented along the eigenvalue axes

- you get a matrix out of the inertia tensor (mass is the same fo all particles) and determine it;s eigenvalues. If you "twist it along those directions"

- show stuff in slices but compute for box

- be careful not to overdo on DTFE

## APs

- try to get the same void on DTFE because
