- gravitational instability of 1st order is that spherical objects don't exist. The second order is that they flatten because acceleration along one axis, will always be higher and will sort of be a runaway event, getting stronger and strongerc compared to the other axes. for the same reason, void regions get more and more spherical.

- alignments on a sphere always go cos(theta) vs phi and not just theta

- rode lijn: reading the report should feel like a story! arguments, results, arguments, resultss, etc. : engage in deviant behaviour
