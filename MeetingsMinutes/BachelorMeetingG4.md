# group Meeting 4 (15.05)

- target is orbits of the particles

- continue working with the non-DTFE stuff to (redshift at 0, select by eye some filament looking feature and some clump, take the mass elements in that particular (particles/subhaloes)); the end target is to find a particular feature and follow it from 0 -> 5 and the other way around

- you will eventually have to apply NEXUS to this and make statistics similar to pg 2950 of Cautun et al 2014 to see what type of structure individual mass particles came from. Basically replicate that paper, but to a larger redshift.

- the chi for the two point thingie function is approximately a **power law**!!! for galaxies. Even the larger Universe likes power laws. Clusters also do this? if you take a cluster and sti at5 mpc you have 5^5.8 chance to see another cluster compared to a galaxy seeing a galaxy

- how clustered is this thing? "I determined the 2-point function and it looks like this" is enough to impress people on your presentation
